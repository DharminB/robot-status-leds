# LED circle

Python code to control and simulate the leds in a circle electronics.

## Execution

Execute with the following command
```
python led_lights.py
```

Note: the code will not work with python3 because the library used (tkinter) has
to be named differently if it is used in python3. Also, with python2, no
additional library installation is required.
